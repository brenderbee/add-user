## Setup/Installation Requirement

* Clone repository on your local computer.
* If you already have Node and Homebrew installed, then skip to "Install Dependencies."

  #### Node: Windows / Linux Installation Instructions
  * To install Node on other systems, go to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node website</a>, download and install the appropriate installer for your operating system.

  #### Node: OSX Installation Instructions
  * On OS X systems, install Node.js through Homebrew with the following command in your home directory:
    * $ brew install node
  * Confirm that node and npm (node package manager, installed automatically with Node) are in place by checking the versions (Node should be 4.0.x or higher, npm should be 3.6.x or higher):
    * $ node -v
    * $ npm -v

  #### Homebrew Installation
  * If you do not have Homebrew installed yet, you may install it by copying and pasting this command:
    * $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  * Next, ensure Homebrew packages are run before the system versions of the same (which may be dated or not what we want) by executing the following:
    * $ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile

  #### Install dependencies
  * Enter the following code in the command line to install all dependencies:
    * $ npm install

  #### Working with the project in Node:
  * To build and bundle the project in webpack run the following:
    * $ npm run build
  * To run the local test server:
    * $ npm run start
  * To run test:
    * $ npm test


## Known Bugs
* When a user is on the last page of entries and executes a sort, the display should change back to a view of the first page with the sort applied. This does not happen and results in an odd user experience.
